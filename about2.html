  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>In the midst of a digital age dominated by data collectors, three friends grew weary of the relentless invasion of privacy. Fueled by frustration, they envisioned a sanctuary where individuals could reclaim their digital autonomy. Thus, Space Legion was born—a community dedicated to empowering others to live a peaceful, privacy-focused life. With determination and unity, they forged a path towards a future where privacy is not a luxury, but a fundamental right for all.</p>
