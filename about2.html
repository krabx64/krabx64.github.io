  <span>While were on the topic, We'd like to share how space legion was born!</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>In the midst of a digital age dominated by data collectors, three friends grew weary of the relentless invasion of privacy. Fueled by frustration, they envisioned a sanctuary where individuals could reclaim their digital autonomy. Thus, Space Legion was born—a community dedicated to empowering others to live a peaceful, privacy-focused life. With determination and unity, they forged a path towards a future where privacy is not a luxury, but a fundamental right for all.</p>

                <p>I have a deep love for old rpgmaker games. My most cherished memories as a young teen were playing rpgmaker games, notably ones like Yume Nikki, .Flow, Yume 2kki, Ib, Witch's House and many others. They are my main source of inspiration. </p> <br>
                <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a056c3532f6bdf526e213ff5e856ee61/b593d534bf9cc133-ab/s250x400/5d2ec1867e8fcfc13adbaa481b9eb967f597dc0b.jpg" style="float:right; padding:5px;"> <p> <br> When I was about 12-13, I was really into anime and I would watch any anime I could possibly find on comcast anime network. Since we couldn't really afford to purchase anime on demand, my parents let me buy this dvd. It was a dubbed Di gi Charat Nyo dvd with 8 episodes. Me and my sister watched those 8 episodes for YEARS. It was something we used as white-noise to go to sleep. Its an important piece of my child hood and when I visited my hometown in 2021, we played that DVD again! Rabi-en-rose is my favorite character and I intend to make a shrine of her at some point.</p>  <br> <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/93d694ede02ecff635eefb09bd7d610a/330ab3c1954dec7d-94/s100x200/4388696217f32c5ee45b26eaa8e55cb23cb30f1e.png" style="float:left; padding:10px;">  <br> Recently, anything by Joel G has become a great interest of mine. I love his work and his ability to make you watch a 8 minute animation at least 20 times. I love Ena too. She's super cute and I love how she has two counterparts. I'm looking forward to anything else he's creating. This project introduced me to Metaroom and I've been obsessed since. <br> <br> <br> <center> <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/773ff8ad33af066e1d138574f32d08bf/817600ce402f5efe-09/s400x600/44c42685c5f7ca786d3fe77f4651d4771d5156c1.gif" style="  width:300px;"> </center>  <p>I can't skip out on classic vocaloid. I should really consider making a personal playlist of every vocaloid song I've ever listened to, especially the super old ones from 10 years ago. Niconicodouga had some gems. </p><br> <p> This will be updated when I remember other things I like! <br> <br><b>Other notable interests: </b> Evangelion, Osamu Tezuka, PS1 video games, GBA games, Sonic, Games and Music by Toby Fox, Making music (or at least trying to), Rhythm Games, Old DS games, Gamedev, Old Internet, Liminal spaces </p>
