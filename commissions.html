                            <b><h2>I. GENERAL TERMS</h2> </b> 


                            <p>
                            I accept money through Paypal and I only use invoices. If any other forms of payment sent, they are not legitimate and will not be considered paid for a commission service. <br><br>

                            I take payment upfront only. Please do not attempt to pay me ahead of time until I have responded and accepted your order. <br><br>

                            Please give clear visual references based on the desired commission order. It is best to be as detailed as needed to avoid misunderstandings. <br><br>

                            If you have a deadline, let me know so that I may prioritize your commission, if you do not have a deadline I will take my time. If a deadline is issued, I will have to add a fee. </p> 



                            <b><h2>II. PROCESS</h2> </b> 
 

                            I will update you the sketch process if desired.
                            You may ask for a WIP of the image at any time. <br><br>

                            If you are unhappy with your WIP during the sketch process you may request minor edits but I can refuse redrawing more than one completed sketch and can ask for a fee for a new complete sketch. <br><br>
                            
                            Once I get approval of the sketch, then that is final.<br><br>

                            If the line work and the color work is completed then I allow mistake edits. Any other large edits is negotiable but might require an extra charge. <br><br>



                            <b><h2>III. CANCELLATION/REFUND POLICY</h2> </b> 
 

                            I will not issue a refund passed the sketch phase approval. <br><br>

                            You are free to cancel any commission request before payment is sent.<br><br>

                            I reserve the right to refund any orders at any time, regardless of the reason, regardless of the person requesting.<br><br>

                            If you file a charge back against me without my consent or no prior discussion with the intent to commit a scam, I will record every interaction and information you've given me that says otherwise to deny your charge back towards Paypal and dispute it. <br><br>I will have all rights to the image you've had me drawn and they are no longer your property. You will not be allowed to commission me again and I will make your name known so that others will not receive the same treatment.<br><br>
