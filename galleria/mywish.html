<small> <b>Authors note:</b> This one made a lot of people cry. I was very surprised. <br>
    I made this entire comic in one night during a manic episode. I don't really know what compelled me to make a story like this. I still don't feel as emotional about it as much as it affected other people. I'm glad people liked it that much. It was my first ever comic. I also regret using so much yellow. Yikes. I put a grayscale filter on it. If you hover, you will see the original colors.  </small>
